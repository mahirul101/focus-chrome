## Usage

### Setting Up Focus Sites

1. Click the FocusBrowse extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. In the "Focus Sites" section, enter the domain of websites you need for studying
   - **Base domain** (e.g., `google.com`) - matches ALL Google services
   - **Specific subdomain** (e.g., `docs.google.com`) - matches ONLY Google Docs
   - You don't need to include `https://`, `www.`, or any paths
3. Click "Add" to add each site to your focus list
4. **Add as many sites as you need** - just keep adding them one by one
5. Remove sites by clicking the "Remove" button next to them

**Example Focus List:**
- `docs.google.com` (for Google Docs)
- `notion.so` (for Notion notes)
- `stackoverflow.com` (for coding help)
- `github.com` (for repositories)
- `coursera.org` (for online courses)

**How Domain Matching Works:**
- **`google.com`** â†’ Matches `google.com`, `docs.google.com`, `drive.google.com`, `mail.google.com`, etc.
- **`docs.google.com`** â†’ Matches ONLY `docs.google.com` and its subdomains (like `api.docs.google.com`)
- **Be as specific or broad as you want!**

### Starting a Focus Session

1. Click the FocusBrowse icon
2. Adjust the "Long Break Duration" if desired (15-30 minutes)
3. Click "Start Focus" to begin your first 25-minute study session
4. A coffee mug will appear in the top-right corner of all tabs
5. On non-focus tabs, you'll see a warning bar at the top

### During Focus Mode

- **Focus Tabs**: Your designated study sites work normally with the coffee mug indicator
- **Non-Focus Tabs**: Show a warning message, slightly dimmed, but still functional
- **Coffee Mug**: Gradually fills up as time progresses, showing your session progress
- **Timer**: Displays remaining time in the coffee mug badge

### Breaks

- After 25 minutes, you'll get a notification for a 5-minute break
- After 4 completed Pomodoros, you'll get a longer break (15-30 minutes)
- During breaks, the warning bars and dim effects are removed
- The extension automatically transitions between focus and break periods

### Stopping a Session

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Choose Your Specificity**: 
   - Add `google.com` if you need ALL Google services
   - Add `docs.google.com` if you only need Google Docs
   - Be as specific or broad as your study needs require
2. **Keep Focus List Relevant**: Add only the sites you genuinely need for your current study session
3. **Honor the Breaks**: Taking breaks is essential for maintaining long-term focus
4. **Use Consistently**: The Pomodoro Technique works best when used regularly
